## Description
this **Question2Answer** plugin allows adding HTML Description to Tag pages, and Title and icons to tag links.
this plugin was originally developed by Gideon Greenspan in [plugin development tutorial](http://www.question2answer.org/plugins-tutorial.php). I just added a few cool features:

## New Features
- adding Title to tags(it will use title text instead of description in tag link's title attribute)
- adding Icon to tags(icon image will show up inside tag links, it's size can be set in admin options page)
- it supports HTML in tag description(can be disabled in plugin option page), so you can add images, links, ... in each tag's page
- css class "qa-tag-description" was added to tag's description container for easy styling

## Installation

1. Download and extract the files to your plugins folder (e.g. `qa-plugins/q2a-tag-descriptions`).
2. In Q2A go to **Admin > Plugins** and set up the setting for "Q2A Tag Descriptions" and save changes.
3. In Q2A go to **Admin > Layout** add it's widget anywhere you want.
4. Open any of your tags and click **edit description** in the position you choose in last step, then add content and save it.

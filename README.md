## Description
this plugin allows adding Tag Description for **Question2Answer**.
this plugin was originally developed by Gideon Greenspan in [plugin development tutorial](http://www.question2answer.org/plugins-tutorial.php). I just added a few cool features:

#### New Features
- adding Title while editing tag description(it will use this title instead of description in tag link's title attribute)
- adding Icon while editing tag description(icon image will show up inside tag links, it's size can be set in admin options page)
- it supports HTML in tag description(can be disabled in plugin option page)
- css class "qa-tag-description" was added to tag's description container for easy styling

## Installation

1. Download and extract the files to your plugins folder (e.g. `qa-plugins/q2a-tag-descriptions`).
2. In Q2A go to **Admin > Plugins** and set up the setting for "Q2A Tag Descriptions" and save changes.
3. In Q2A go to **Admin > Layout** add it's widget anywhere you want.
4. Open any of your tags and click **edit description** in the position you choose in last step, then add content and save it.
